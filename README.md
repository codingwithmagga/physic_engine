# Physic Engine with GUI

A C++ library/application using OpenGL to design a physic engine with a gui. Currently working through an [OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) tutorial to add a basic visualisation.

Ideas:

* Creating easy simulations like falling balls
* Creating some small games like snake or pong
* Creating advanced simulations like fluid
